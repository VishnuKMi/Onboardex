### API Documentation:

To interact with Wearable-NFT, developers can leverage our comprehensive API.

### Rate Limits and Usage Guidelines:

To maintain fair usage and ensure system stability, Wearable-NFT may have rate limits or usage restrictions.

- Rate Limits: Specify the allowed number of requests per minute, hour, or day.
- Usage Guidelines: Explain any additional guidelines or restrictions developers should be aware of when utilizing the API.
- Monitoring: Guide developers on how to monitor their API usage and handle rate limit exceeded scenarios.

### API Endpoint:

1. **/api/main**

The **`/api/main`** endpoint is a crucial part of integrating Wearable-NFT into your application. It is called when a customer places an order, and it triggers the sending of an email with a link to claim the respective NFT. The endpoint requires the following payload parameters:

- email: The email address of the customer who placed the order.
- apiKey: Your unique API key for authentication and authorization.
- productId: The ID of the product associated with the order.

The request payload should be sent as a JSON object in the body of the API request.

**Example API Request:**

```
POST /api/main
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer {apiKey}

{
  "email": "customer@example.com",
  "apiKey": "your_api_key",
  "productId": "12345"
}
```

**Example API Response:**

```
jsonCopy code
{
  "status": "success",
  "message": "Email sent successfully."
}
```

### Authentication:

To ensure secure and authorized access, Wearable-NFT supports API key-based authentication. To authenticate your requests, include the API key in the **`Authorization`** header of your API calls. Use the following format:

```
Authorization: Bearer {apiKey}
```

Replace **`{apiKey}`** with your actual API key.

### Rate Limits and Usage Guidelines:

To maintain fair usage and ensure system stability, rate limits are imposed on API requests. The rate limits are as follows:

- Maximum Requests per Minute: 100
- Maximum Requests per Hour: 1000

Please adhere to these limits to avoid disruptions in service. If you require higher limits or have specific usage requirements, please contact our support team.
